These are some scripts used during the project, they are not necessary for running the passes but might make things easier.

These scripts were highly specific to the setup used for the project, and some of
them might not make sense for your needs/goals. If you are
interested you are welcome to examine these and repurpose them
for your own usage. If you have questions email me at jonatanwaern@gmail.com, I am not available for debugging but will otherwise help you.

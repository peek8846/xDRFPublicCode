GIT Repo for the code for the xDRF delimitation and optimization project.

The project loosely executes in 5 phases
1: Determine synchronization operations in a program, and construct a graph of these operations according to control flow
2: Determine the synchronization variables used by synchronization operations
3: Determine critical (nDRF) regions based on 1
4: Determine the enclaveness of each nDRF region by cross-checking preceding and following xDRF paths based on 2 and 3
5: Mark the border of ndRF and xDRF regions in code with marker functions based on 4

Passes included:
Main passes:
SynchPointDelim : Executes 1, 2 and 3
XDRFExtension : Executes 4
MarkXDRFRegions : Executes 5

Auxiliary passes:
ThreadDependence : Determines which values in a program are derived from thread arguments or may contain values derived from thread arguments
MarkRMSRegions : Created nDRF-style marker functions from RMS-style marker functions
VerifyXDRF : Verifies the differences between xDRF-style marker functions and RMS-style marker function for a program. Not 100% accurate.
PatchRMSFunctions : Deprecated

In addition, some scripts exist that might be useful. These are located under "utility":
addXDRFMarksAtManual.sh : Deprecated by MarkRMSRegions pass
envSetup.sh : Sets up entire environment, must be adapted to your setup
llvm-env.sh : Deprecated by switch to LLVM 3.8
llvm-env2.sh : Sets up environment variables for LLVM based on the current working dir
obtainStaticStats.sh : Runs the verify script on each benchmark
PatchAllInDir.sh : Deprecated by MarkRMSRegions
patchXDRF.sh : Deprecated by MarkRMSRegions
pin-env.sh : Sets up environment variables for PIN based on the current working dir
plotStaticStats.sh : Generates a pdf graph over the static comparison between RMS and xDRF for all benchmarks
runPass.sh : Runs the entire xDRF analysis on a benchmark
runPin.sh : Runs a compiled benchmark through the pin analysis
runRMSPatch.sh : Deprecated with PatchRMSFunctions
run-verify.sh : Runs the VerifyXDRF pass on a benchmark
SanityCheck.sh : Deprecated
viewGraph : Converts a .dot file into a pdf and opens it
xdrf-env : Sets up the environment variables for XDRF based on the current working dir
